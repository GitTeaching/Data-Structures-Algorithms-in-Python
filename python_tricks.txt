[2.1] - Key Takeaways : Covering Your A** With Assertions
• Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition as an internal self-check in your program.
• Asserts should only be used to help developers identify bugs. They’re not a mechanism for handling run-time errors.
• Asserts can be globally disabled with an interpreter setting.
