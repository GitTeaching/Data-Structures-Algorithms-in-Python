Chapter 1 :

[2.1] - Key Takeaways : Covering Your A** With Assertions
• Python’s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a condition as an internal self-check in your program.
• Asserts should only be used to help developers identify bugs. They’re not a mechanism for handling run-time errors.
• Asserts can be globally disabled with an interpreter setting.

[2.2] - Key Takeaways : Complacent Comma Placement
• Smart formatting and comma placement can make your list, dict, or set constants easier to maintain.
• Python’s string literal concatenation feature can work to your benefit, or introduce hard-to-catch bugs.

[2.3] - Key Takeaways : Context Managers and the with Statement
• The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating standard uses of try/finally statements in so-called context managers.
• Most commonly it is used to manage the safe acquisition and release of system resources. Resources are acquired by the with statement and released automatically when execution
leaves the with context.
• Using with effectively can help you avoid resource leaks and make your code easier to read.
• Class-based contexte manager : Python calls __enter__ when execution enters the context of the with statement and it’s time to acquire the resource. When execution leaves the context again, Python calls __exit__ to free up the resource. Or : The contextlib7 utility module.

[2.4] - Key Takeaways : Underscores, Dunders, and More
• Single Leading Underscore “_var”: Naming convention indicating a name is meant for internal use. Generally not enforced by the Python interpreter (except in wildcard imports)
and meant as a hint to the programmer only.
• Single Trailing Underscore “var_”: Used by convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.
• Double Leading Underscore “__var”: Triggers name mangling when used in a class context. Enforced by the Python interpreter.
• Double Leading and Trailing Underscore “__var__”: Indicates special methods defined by the Python language. Avoid this naming scheme for your own attributes.
• Single Underscore “_”: Sometimes used as a name for temporary or insignificant variables (“don’t care”). Also, it represents the result of the last expression in a Python REPL session.
